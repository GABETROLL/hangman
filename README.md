# hangman
A very old project I made. I found this YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxWMUV_9fKU which gave me the idea, since I wanted to make a project that wasn't for immediate begginners, but wasn't advanced either.
## Installation
Clone this respository:
```
$ git clone git@github.com:GABETROLL/hangman.git
cd hangman/
```
## How to play the game
I made ``Hangman.exe``, which can be ran in Windows. Although this was a long time ago, and I'm not sure if it will run properly.
For linux:
```
$ python3 console_hangman.py
```
